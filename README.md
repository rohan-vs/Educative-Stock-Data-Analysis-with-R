# Educative's Stock Data Analysis with R Question
## Project Description
R is a programming language and integrated environment that centers on statistics, but also has various applications in other fields. Stock and investment analysis is a technical domain that is well suited to R. This project uses basic R, as well as the quantmod and ggplot2 libraries, to analyze stocks and investments.

In this project, we will explore the basic techniques of visualizing stock market data, calculating moving averages to analyze trends, and computing the returns.

For this, we’ll use the Paltalk, Inc (PALT) stock. Paltalk is a communications software provider that develops secure solutions for multimedia communication and data transmission. For the purpose of this project, we will only analyze a part of the PALT stock dataset. However, we can apply the techniques we’ll learn here to the entire dataset.
